This is a repository for the linux sources for CBSWin, found there : http://dmweb.free.fr/community/clones/chaos-strikes-back-for-windows-and-linux-raspbian-macos-x-pocket-pc/

PAUL R STEVENS doesn't want to maintain them for now.
The latest sources from Paul are here https://www.dianneandpaul.net/CSBwin/CSBwin_SRC_20230608.7z
but they have been merged into this git quite some time ago already.

You can compile a windows version either 32 or 64 bits from this source, or a linux version. Just
select the right target at the top of the makefile. For now the only thing required is sdl2.

You'll find a summary of the changes in this forum thread : (along with links to
the binary version, containing dungeon.dat and graphics.dat for the original
dungeon master).
