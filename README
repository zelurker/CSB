This is a repository for the linux sources for CBSWin, found there : http://dmweb.free.fr/community/clones/chaos-strikes-back-for-windows-and-linux-raspbian-macos-x-pocket-pc/

PAUL R STEVENS doesn't want to maintain the sources anymore so I'll at least maintain some linux sources for now.

This is based originally on the latest sources available from there : https://www.dianneandpaul.net/CSBwin/CSBwin_SRC_20190702.7z
You'll need some data files from the site over there :
Dungeon master http://dianneandpaul.net/CSBwin/Games/DM_linux_x64_SDL20_20180508.tar
Chaos strikes back http://dianneandpaul.net/CSBwin/CSBwin_linux_x86-64_SDL20_20180421-1550

I intend to maintain only the linux version here, I don't use MSVC.
Build instructions : super simple, there is a makefile in the src directory, I'll try to make sure
the options line is the one for an optimized build, but you can double check in the Ubuntu_SDL20
section. Oh by the way the old sdl12 section is not tested anymore neither.
Just build with make that's all. The sources require sdl2, and just the include files for glib2
which is used apparently only for its types, it's not linked.

So far changes for the linux version from the 20190702 sources :
 - 1st the savegame names were in uppercase, well in linux normal files are in lower case, so
   changed all of them to lowercase.
 - in the makefile there is now a line for debug options, and a line for optimized build, just using
   -O2 for optimized build, and -fsantize=address in debug mode. Got a crash once when using a -O2
   build so I had to check things, just found a small buffer overflow when saving the game. Also
   added a 'clean' target.
 - The window is now resizable and its default size is 320x4 x 200x4, closer to usual resolutions
   these days and still quie below most.
 - Handling of alt+return to toggle fullscreen mode with sdl2.
 - Handles the window close event, so that if you quit the game by closing the window it doesn't
   just crash (with a core dump !)
 - And I had a strange crash as soon as trying to play some audio in the game the 1st time I used
   the source. I am not totally sure of the cause, but using a pointer instead of a static global
   for sdlChannels seems to fix it for some reason, just added a comment about that, now everything
   seems to work.
 - Fixed audio pitch too high, it was a bad frequency when opening the audio device
 - Fixed bad handling of scan codes for the keyboard, I'll leave a fixed config.linux file with the
   correct scan codes for the numpad in it outside the src directory.
